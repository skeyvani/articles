Exploring the Power of R
========================
First I'm going to load ggplot2 and RColorBrewer packages. Then I'll load the  diamonds dataset which contains 53,940 rows of data about round cut diamonds including prices.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("RColorBrewer")
data(diamonds)
```

Here's some info about the dataset

```{r}
str(diamonds)
head(diamonds)
```

As you can see there are 10 variables for each row. You can use `?diamonds` to learn more about this dataset.

Now I'll use a basic `qplot` function to create an amazing visualization that plots the price vs carats and uses colors to display different cut qualities.

```{r fig.width=12}
qplot(data = diamonds, x = carat, y = price, color = cut) + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```
